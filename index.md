# **Changes in the Area of Surface Water in Lake Oroville**


## **Abstract**
<p>
    Surface water has an important relationship with both the climate and human well being, thus it is important for us to monitor and support these bodies of water as the climate continues to change. We used images captured with varying wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum to identify differences between water and non-water areas, and to analyze how these bodies of water change over time. More details can be found in the main sections located in the nav-bar above!
